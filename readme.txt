[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod makes a minor change to the forum to return [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes]HTML error codes[/url] when topics and boards are missing.

By definition, a 404 error code (Not Found) is this:
[quote]The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.[/quote]
and a 410 error code (Gone) is this:
[quote]Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. [citation needed] Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.[/quote]
